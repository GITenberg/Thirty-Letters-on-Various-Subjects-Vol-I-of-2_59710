    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HETHER these are real letters, or whether the author chose to throw
    his observations into the epistolary form, is a point of no great
    consequence. The invention of a story to shew how they came into the
    editor’s hands is by no means difficult.—A parcel of papers rescued
    from the trunk-maker or pastry-cook, has saved
    <span class="pagenum">vi</span> many an author from
    perishing. <span class="smcap gesperttn">Cervantes</span>
    and <span class="smcap gesperttn">Sterne</span> were
    not above such shifts; but they have served so often, that now, even
    the truth, tho’ without the least mixture of the marvellous, passes for
    invention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Should these little volumes contain any new and useful observations on
    men and things, it is a sufficient reason for their publication—if the
    physic be wholesome, it is no matter under what form it is administered.

  <p class="dropindent">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE you request that our correspondence should be out of the beaten
    track, be it so. My retirement from the world will naturally give an
    air of peculiarity to my sentiments, which perhaps may entertain where
    it does not convince. In justice to myself, let me
    <span class="pagenum">2</span> observe, that truth
    sometimes does not strike us without the assistance of custom; but
    so great is the force of custom, that, unassisted by truth, it has
    worked the greatest miracles. Need I bring for proof the quantity of
    nonsense in all the arts, sciences, and even religion itself, which
    it has sanctified? As possibly in the course of my letters to you I
    may attack some received doctrines on each of these subjects, let not
    what I advance be instantly rejected, because contrary to an opinion
    founded on prejudice; but, as much as possible, divest yourself of the
    partiality acquired by habit, and if at last you should not agree with
    me, I shall suspect my sentiments to be peculiar and not just.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">3</span>
    Tho’ truth may want the assistance of use before we feel its force,
    yet when it is really felt, we detest what custom only made us like.
    The difficulty is to procure for truth a fair examination. The
    multitude is always against it. The first discovery in any thing is
    considered as an encroachment upon property, a property become sacred
    by possession. Discoverers are accordingly treated as criminals, and
    must have good luck to escape execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mean not to rank myself with such bold adventurers; I am neither
    ambitious of the honour, or the danger, of enlightening the world, but,
    if I can soften prejudices which I cannot remove—if I
    <span class="pagenum">4</span> can loosen the
    fetters of custom where I cannot altogether unbind them, and engage
    you to think for yourself—my end will be answered, and my trouble fully
    repaid.

    <h2><span class="gesperttw">LETTER </span>II.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="dropindent">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is natural to suppose, that people originally judged of things
    by their senses and immediate perceptions. By degrees they found
    that their senses were not infallible, and that things frequently
    contradicted their first appearance. This, at last, was pushed to an
    extravagance; and certain philosophers endeavoured to persuade mankind,
    that the senses deceive us so often, that we can never depend on
    them—that we cannot tell whether we are in motion or at rest, asleep or
    awake,<span class="pagenum">6</span>
    with many other such absurdities. They used the same ingenuity
    with the mental sense. Some ancient sage was asked, “Who is the
    richest man?” if he had replied “He that has most money,” the answer
    would have been natural and just—what he did say, every one knows. We
    have suffered ourselves to be imposed on so long, that at last we begin
    to impose on ourselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Riches, cards, and duelling, have been constantly abused, written,
    and preached against; and yet men will still hoard, play, and fight.
    Why should they? All universal passions we may fairly pronounce to
    be natural, and should be treated with respect. The gratification
    of our passions are our greatest pleasures,
    <span class="pagenum">7</span> and he that has most
    gratifications is of course the happiest man. This, as a general
    assertion, is true, and it is true also in particulars, provided we pay
    no more for pleasure than it is worth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every man should endeavour to be rich. He that has money may possess
    every thing that is transferable—this is a sufficient inducement to
    procure it. Nay, if he possesses nothing but his money, if he considers
    it as the end, as well as the means, it is still right to be rich: for,
    knowing that he has it in his power to procure every thing, he is as
    well satisfied as is the thing itself was in his possession. This is
    the true source of the miser’s pleasure; and a great pleasure it is!
    A moral<span class="pagenum">8</span>
    philosopher may tell him, “that man does not live for himself
    alone, and that he hurts the community by withholding what would
    be of use to it”—this he thinks to be weak reasoning. The sneers of
    wits signify as little; for he knows they would be glad to be rich if
    they could. He feels that the pleasure arising from the possession of
    riches, whether used or not, is too great to be given up for all the
    wit, or even the strongest arguments that can be brought against it.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seems to be agreed, that card-playing proceeds entirely from
    avarice—tho’ this may sometimes be the motive, yet it may with more
    probability be derived from other, and more general principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">9</span>
    The mind of man naturally requires employment, and that employment
    is most agreeable, which engages, without fatiguing the attention.
    There is nothing for this purpose of such universal attraction as
    cards. The fine arts and belles lettres can only be enjoyed by those
    who have a genius for them—other studies and amusements have their
    particular charm, but cards are the universal amusement in every
    country where they are known. The alternate changes in the play, the
    hope upon the taking up a new hand, and the triumph of getting a game,
    made more compleat from the fear of losing it, keep the mind in a
    perpetual agitation, which is found by experience to be too agreeable
    to be quitted<span class="pagenum">10</span>
    for any other consideration. The stake played for is a
    quickener of these sensations, but not the cause. Children who play for
    nothing feel what I have been describing perhaps in a more exquisite
    degree than he who engages for thousands. A state of inaction is of
    all others the most dreadful! and it is to avoid this inaction that we
    seek employment, though at the expence of health, temper, and fortune.
    This subject is finely touched by Abbé du Bos, in his reflexions upon
    poetry, &amp;c. indeed he carries it so far as to say, that the pleasure
    arising from an extraordinary agitation of the mind, is frequently so
    great as to stifle humanity; and from hence arises the entertainment of
    the common<span class="pagenum">11</span>
    people at executions, and of the better sort at tragedies.
    Tho’ in this last instance he may be mistaken; yet, the delight we
    feel in reading the actions of a hero may be referred to this cause.
    The moralist censures the taste of those who can be pleased with the
    actions of an Alexander or a Nadir Shah—the Truth is, we do not approve
    the actions; but the relation of them causes that agitation of the
    mind which we find to be pleasant. The reign of Henry the seventh,
    tho’ of the greatest consequence to this nation, does not interest us
    like the contentions of York and Lancaster by which the kingdom was
    ruined.—It is in vain that we are told that scenes of war and bloodshed
    can<span class="pagenum">12</span>
    give no pleasure to a good mind, and that the true hero is he who
    cultivates the arts of peace, he by whom men are benefited not he by
    whom they are destroyed—it is to no purpose—we sleep over the actions
    of quiet goodness, while aspiring, destroying greatness, claims and
    commands our attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Duelling has in many countries a law against it—but can never be
    prevented. The law can inflict no greater penalty for any breach of it
    than death; which the duellist contemns.—There are also some cases of
    injury which the law cannot prevent, nor punish when committed—these
    must be redressed by the man who suffers, and by him <em>only</em>. He is
    prompted to do this by something
    <span class="pagenum">13</span> antecedent, and superior to all law,
    and by a desire as eager as hunger or lust; so that it is as easy
    for law to prevent or restrain the two latter as the former. Very
    luckily for us, occasions for the gratifications of this passion occur
    but seldom: and tho’ a man may be restrained from a duel by personal
    fear, which is its only counteractor, there are very few instances,
    perhaps none, of its being prevented by considering it so a breach of
    the law. In the beginning of the last century duels were as frequent,
    particularly in France, as to occasion a severe edict to prevent
    them—indeed by their frequency, they were by degrees improved into
    combats<span class="pagenum">14</span>
    of two, three, and sometimes more of a side.—In those days
    a French nobleman was making up his party to decide a quarrel with
    another man of equal rank, it came to the King’s ears, who sent to him
    one of the most rising men at court with a command to desist, assuring
    him of the strict execution of the edict in case of disobedience.—Every
    one knows the attachment of the French to their sovereign, but yet it
    proved weak when set against this all-powerful passion. The nobleman
    not only refused to obey the king, but actually engaged the messenger
    to be one of his party.

    The above seem to be the principal reasons why riches, cards, and
    <span class="pagenum">15</span>
    duelling have so deep a root in the mind of man—but there are others
    which come in aid. The desire of superiority is of itself almost
    sufficient to produce this great effect.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Cannot comply with your desire—a regular dissertation is above
    me——but if you will take my thoughts as they occur, the honour of
    methodizing them shall be yours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Languages are termed rough and smooth, weak or expressive, frequently
    without reason.—As these are comparative terms, they change their
    application according to circumstances. The French is said to be a
    smooth or rough language, when compared with the German
    <span class="pagenum">17</span> or Italian.
    Perhaps this is true, and yet we should not determine too hastily.
    In appearance, there are more vowels in the Italian language than in
    the French; but in pronunciation the French lose many Consonants, and
    the Italians none: and yet in French, so great is the irregularity
    of that language, many consonants are pronounced which are not
    written——smoothness or roughness must therefore depend on the ear
    alone, yet how far a Language is weak or expressive, may be treated of
    and determined with precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every sentence may be considered as the picture of an idea; the quicker
    that picture is presented to the mind, the stronger is its
    <span class="pagenum">18</span> Impression.
    That language then which is shortest, is the most expressive. If
    we should fix on any language as being in general the most concise,
    yet, if in some instances it is more diffuse than another, then, in
    those instances the latter is most expressive. This, I believe, is an
    universal rule, and without exception.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us for the present suppose Latin to be more expressive, because
    shorter, than any modern language, and compare it with English in some
    examples, just as they occur. <i xml:lang="la">Captus oculis</i> and <i xml:lang="la">cœcus</i>—are used for
    the same thing—the last is more expressive than the first, and both
    less so than blind: a single syllable does the office of many. How much
    <span class="pagenum">19</span>
    more forcibly does it strike us to be told that our friend is dead,
    than <i xml:lang="la">mortuus est</i>, or <i xml:lang="la">Mors continuo ipsum occupavit</i>? This last is
    indeed poetical, if we suppose death a person. Tho’ I just now said
    that Latin was closer in its expression than any modern language, it
    was only in compliance with common opinion; for I have great reason to
    believe that it yields in this respect to English: The latin hexameter
    and Terence’s line being with ease included in our heroic verse,
    which is not so long by many syllables. There have been many pieces
    of English poetry translated into Latin, and, in general nothing can
    read more dead and unanimated. In the eighth volume of the Spectator
    is a translation<span class="pagenum">20</span>
    of the famous soliloquy in the Play of Cato—compare
    it with the original, and observe how the same thought is strong in
    English and weak in Latin, occasioned entirely by its being close in
    one language, and diffuse in the other: for, as much as one sentence
    exceeds another in length, in the same proportion does it fail in
    expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    Translations, most commonly, are more verbose than their original,
    which is one reason for their weakness; whenever they are less so, they
    are stronger. Suppose we should find in a French author these phrases,
    <i xml:lang="fr">Un Canon de neuf livres de Balle—Un Vaisseau du Roi du quatre
    vingt dix Pieces du Canon</i>; and they were rendered into English by
    <em>a nine-pounder—A ninety-gun<span class="pagenum">21</span>
    ship</em>—is not the translation more spirited
    than the original? I purposely chose a phrase with as little matter in
    it as possible, where the meaning could not be mistaken, and in which
    there was no variety of expression, that the trial might be fairer. I
    have heard that the German is an expressive language—it may be so, I
    do not understand it; but I can perceive that, for the most part, the
    words are very long, which makes against its being so. French, and
    Italian particularly, are much more diffuse than English. Translations
    from these languages have often a force that the originals wanted; and
    this not owing to the English being a stronger language in <em>sound</em>, as
    some<span class="pagenum">22</span>
    have imagined, but to strength occasioned by brevity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps it may be imagined, that those words which carry their
    signification with them should be most expressive, whether long or
    short; that is, when they are derived from, or compounded of known
    words, which express that signification. But this is not so. When we
    say <i xml:lang="fr">adieu</i>, <em>farewell</em>—we mean no more than a ceremony at parting.—No
    one considers <i xml:lang="fr">adieu</i> as a recommendation to God, or <em>farewell</em> as
    a wish for happiness.—Frequent use destroys all idea of derivation.
    But if we speak a compound or self-significative word that is not
    common, we perceive the derivation of it.
    <span class="pagenum">23</span> Thus if a Londoner says
    <em>butter-milk</em>, he has an idea of something compounded of butter and
    milk; but to an Irishman or Hollander, it is as simple an idea as
    either of the words taken separately, is to us.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is but late that our orthography was fixed even in the most common
    words. Two hundred years ago, every person spelt as he liked: a
    privilege enjoyed still later than that period by “royal and noble
    authors,” who seem, in this instance, to claim the liberty enjoyed by
    their ancestors. Since the time orthography has been thought of some
    consequence, we have attended partly to pronunciation, tho’ chiefly
    to derivation. But, in some cases, where we should altogether
    <span class="pagenum">24</span> have
    spelt according to derivation, we have taken pronunciation for our
    guide. And this has occasioned some confusion; for instance <em>naught</em>
    is <em>bad</em>—<em>nought</em> is <em>nothing</em>; these terms were long confounded, and
    even now are not kept perfectly distinct, which has occasioned <em>ought</em>
    to be written <em>aught</em>. <em>Wrapt</em> is envelloped—<em>rapt</em> is hurried away,
    or totally possessed: the first of these is frequently used for the
    last, by some of our modern poets. <em>Marry</em> is an asseveration—<em>marry</em>,
    to give in marriage—the spelling these words the same, confounds
    them together; we should have preserved for the first, the real word
    <em>mary</em>. It was a common thing formerly to swear
    <span class="pagenum">25</span> by <em>Mary</em>, the <em>a</em> in
    which was pronounced broad, as the Priests of that time did the Latin
    <em>Maria</em>, from whom the common people took the pronunciation. In one
    of the pieces in the first volume of the collection of old plays, it
    frequently occurs, and is spelt as a proper name, <em>Marie</em>. Permit me
    to observe, that the Editor, by modernizing the spelling in the other
    volumes, has prevented their being made this use of, as they might have
    shewed the progress of orthography as well as of dramatic poetry.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the reign of James the first were many attempts to reduce
    orthography altogether to pronunciation. In our time we have seen some
    attempts to bring it altogether<span class="pagenum">26</span>
    from derivation—but surely both were
    wrong. Whoever reads Howel’s letters, or Dr. Newton’s Milton, will
    see, that by a partial principle too generally adopted, they have
    made of the English language “a very fantastical banquet—just so many
    strange dishes!”
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many inversions of phrases used in poetry which are contrary
    to the genius of our language. In the translation of the Iliad
    there frequently occurs “thunders the sky”——“totters the ground,”
    meaning that “the sky thunders” and “the ground totters.” This change
    of position has the authority of some of our best poets, tho’ it
    frequently obscures the sense, and sometimes
    <span class="pagenum">27</span> makes it directly contrary
    to what is intended to be expressed. Our language does not, with
    ease, admit of the nominative after the verb. If we read, tho’ in
    poetry, “shakes the ground” we do not readily understand that “the
    ground shakes,” but rather refer to some antecedent nominative that
    has produced this effect. To adopt the construction of the ancient
    languages is as awkward as to adopt their measures. You will understand
    this to be meant as a general observation, the truth of which is not
    destroyed by a few exceptions where the inversion may be happily
    used. The sense in these verses of Pope “halts” as much by Roman
    <span class="pagenum">28</span>
    construction, as the Rhythmus in Sidney does by “Roman feet.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In reading Latin and Greek we are obliged to keep the sense suspended
    until we come to the end of the period, but it is not so in any modern
    language that I know of, except now and then in Italian poetry; so that
    there is a sameness of construction in all of them when compared with
    the ancient languages. Now, this suspension of the sense is surely no
    advantage, therefore if it were possible to make English like Latin and
    Greek in this respect, it would hurt the language.

  <p>Dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am glad you go on with your painting. Though you should never arrive
    at any great degree of excellence yourself, it will infallibly make
    you a better judge of the excellencies of others. You tell me, what
    indeed every Connoisseur says by rote, that the great painters painted
    above, beyond nature! That they painted beyond nature I grant, but not
    above, if by above we are to understand something
    <span class="pagenum">33</span> more excellent than
    what we find in nature. I have long been sick of the cant of writers
    and talkers upon this subject. If it be possible, let us speak a little
    common-sense—endeavour to shew what seems by our feelings to be the
    truth, and then prevent a wrong application of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The great painters, it is agreed, painted beyond nature—but how? Why,
    if I may venture to say it, by drawing and colouring extravagantly. But
    were they right or wrong in doing so? This depends upon circumstances.
    I remember seeing at a Painter’s a head taken from nature, another
    copied from Hans Holbein, and a third from Giulio Romano—upon which
    <span class="pagenum">34</span>
    the artist made a dissertation.—He first produced the portrait from
    nature, and asked me how I liked it? I told him that there appeared
    to me great simplicity and elegance in it, and an excellence which
    I thought essential to a good picture—a proper ballance between the
    light and shade of every part. (I meant that the shade of the white was
    lighter than that of blue—of blue fainter than of black, &amp;c. so that
    each colour was as perceivable in the shadows as lights.) Ay, says he,
    that is true, but I will shew you a style preferable to it—Upon which
    he produced the copy from Holbein.—I agreed, that it was stronger, and
    such as nature might appear in many instances.——But
    <span class="pagenum">35</span> here, says he, is
    something <em>beyond</em> nature; this I call the sublime style of painting,
    and this I will try to bring my heads to.—Then he discovered the
    copy from Giulio—there is strength, says he—see how faint the others
    are.—Now, acknowledge that the picture I painted from nature is nothing
    to it. It must be confessed, I replied, that the extravagance of the
    last picture does for a moment dazzle our eyes—yours seems weak by
    the comparison, it is like looking upon white paper after staring at
    the sun.—On the contrary, if I pass from yours to this, I am hurt at
    seeing every thing so extravagant, and so far <em>beyond the modesty of
    nature</em>!—“It is not intended to be strictly
    <span class="pagenum">36</span> natural, it is the <em>fine
    ideal</em>, it is something above, beyond nature!” “I must own that I
    have no idea of any beauty beyond what may be found in nature—indeed,
    whence is the idea to be taken? But do not think I rate Giulio or any
    of the sublime painters lightly; I am so sensible of their merit,
    that, contrary perhaps to your expectation, I am about to defend their
    practice. They generally painted for churches, where the picture is
    seen in a bad light, or at a distance; so that it could not be seen
    at all if the manner was not violent: both the drawing and colouring
    must be extravagant to strike—for which reason, they overcharged their
    attitudes, blackened their shadows,<span class="pagenum">37</span>
    reddened their carnations, and whitened their lights; and
    all this with the greatest propriety. But
    if you apply this practice to closet or portrait painting, what is an
    excellence in them, becomes a defect in you. This picture which you
    have copied with so much success, I dare say has an admirable effect
    where it hangs; but near the eye or in a strong light, it is hard and
    over-done. On the other hand, if your portrait was to be hung at a
    great distance, or in an obscure place, the delicate touches I now
    admire would escape the sight. The style proper for the church is
    improper for the closet, and the contrary. The great painters were in
    the right then, in painting <em>beyond<span class="pagenum">38</span>
    nature</em>; but let us not imagine
    that such figures and characters are therefore the most beautiful.
    No painter can invent a figure surpassing the <em>finest</em> of nature: for
    character and form, nature is the <em>just</em> and <em>only</em> standard. He shews
    his genius more by properly associating natural objects, and expressing
    natural characters, than by exaggerating them or by inventing new ones.”

    with as much sincerity as

  </div>

  <p class="dropindent">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU have turned my thoughts much towards painting of late—I have been
    trying to solve this question.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is the reason that those objects which displease us, or at best,
    that pass unnoticed, in nature, please us most in painting?
  </p>

  <p>
    A deep road, a puddle of water, a bank covered with docks and
    briars, and an old tree or two, are all the circumstances in many a
    fine landscape. As clowns and half starved cattle are the figures a
    <span class="pagenum">40</span>
    landscape-painter chuses for his pictures; so, rough-looking fellows
    wrapt up in sheets and blankets, are chosen by the history-painter, to
    express the greatest personages, and in the most dignified actions of
    their lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let the following observations have what weight they may—tho’ they do
    not clearly answer, they seem to throw some light on this difficult
    question.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. While we are uncultivated, like the Irish Oscar, if we are to
    be awakened, it must be by having a great stone thrown against our
    heads. The man of the utmost elegance and refinement may remember the
    time when, in reading, nothing moved him but the marvellous,
    <span class="pagenum">41</span> and in
    painting, nothing pleased him but the glaring. While he was in this
    state, he delighted in books of chivalry and Chinese pictures—these
    gave place to less extravagant representations of life; and at last
    by much converse with men of taste, reading purer authors, and seeing
    better pictures, he is taught how to feel, and finds a perfect
    revolution even in his sensations. Those objects which once delighted
    him, he now despises—these, on the contrary, he formerly took no notice
    of, he now sees with rapture; and even goes so far as to admire the
    objects in nature, <em>he has learnt</em> to like in representation.—Now, it
    is this improved, tho’ artificial state of
    <span class="pagenum">42</span> the mind that constitutes
    the judge of painting—and it is the judge the painter is sollicitous
    to please.—He is to attain this end then, by departing as much as
    possible from what is our natural barbarous taste, and by conforming to
    that we have acquired.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. It is most certain that in all the arts we make difficulties in
    order to shew our skill in conquering them.—Some French writer calls
    this principle <i xml:lang="fr">la difficultè vaincue</i>; and this conquest is the source
    of much pleasure. What is it but this that induces the novellist
    and play-writer to embarrass their characters with difficulties and
    troubles? What is there but this that can make a musical canon to be
    <span class="pagenum">43</span>
    thought fine in composition, or extravagant execution in performance
    agreeable, when the mind cannot comprehend the one, nor the ear follow
    the other? and, to bring it to the present subject—what is it but this
    that induces the painter to make use of the most unpromising objects,
    and produce beauty where you might expect nothing but deformity?
  </p>

  <p>
    3. It is necessary that a painter should chuse such objects as are
    capable of variety either from shape or arrangement. Regular formal
    objects admit but little, especially those where art has the greatest
    share in their production, unless they are capable of motion, as ships,
    windmills, &amp;c. and then<span class="pagenum">44</span>
    they become pictoresque by a proper choice
    of attitude. It is curious to observe the shifts to which artists
    are reduced, when they are obliged to paint such objects as are in
    themselves unpictoresque—suppose a fine house with avenues of trees.
    They will vary the tint of the stones in the one, and of the leaves in
    the other, or by throwing in accidental shades and lights produce a
    variety. In like manner, portrait-painters undress the hair, loosen the
    coat, and wrinkle the stockings that they may produce a variety in the
    <em>manner</em> of <em>treating</em> a subject which wanted it in form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those objects which have no set form have of course most variety.
    <span class="pagenum">45</span> A
    road or river may wind in any direction—trees are of all sizes and
    shapes, may stand here or there—loose drapery admits of a thousand
    folds and dispositions which the stiff modern dress is incapable of. So
    that the painter by taking these has ample materials for shewing his
    judgment in form, or skill in arrangement——for making, and overcoming
    difficulties—and lastly, by the uniting both these he conforms to the
    principles by which the cultivated taste is pleased—the ultimate end of
    all the fine arts.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Do not admit your excuse.—A genius should never comply with <em>local</em>
    or <em>temporary</em> taste—instead of debasing himself to the people, he
    should elevate the people to him. When Milton subtilizes divinity, and
    Shakespeare “cracks the wind of a poor phrase;” who but wishes that
    those great poets had not descended from their sphere?
  </p>

  <p>
    Your allusions to incidents which must soon be forgot, are only worthy
    of a writer who expects but a short existence. It is true our
    <span class="pagenum">47</span> plays
    abound with such allusions. When Foigard, in the Beaux Stratagem,
    says he is a subject of the King of Spain—they ask him in a fury
    “which King of Spain?” This did very well at the time; but these two
    Kings of Spain are now of much less consequence than their brother
    monarchs of Brentford. I think it is in the same play where one of the
    characters is asked “when he was at church last?” he should answer “at
    the coronation;” but it is a point to give a reply that shall suit
    the time when the play is performed, forgetting that there are many
    expressions which remove you back into the last century when the play
    was written. I remember in the<span class="pagenum">48</span>
    late King’s reign the reply used to be
    “at the installation;” at the accession of his present Majesty an
    actor thought he had a good opportunity of returning to “coronation,”
    but unluckily it was before the King was crowned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Allusions of this sort soon become obscure, and yet they will not bear
    being altered. “Pray you avoid them.”

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>RUE, my friend, musicians do commit strange absurdities by way of
    expression—but fanciful people make them commit others which they never
    thought of.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most common mistake of composers is to express words and not ideas.
    This is generally the case with Purcel, and frequently with Handel. I
    believe there is not a single piece existing of the former, if it has
    a word to be played upon, but will prove my assertion: and the latter,
    if the<span class="pagenum">50</span>
    impetuosity of the musical subject will give him leave, will
    at any time quit it for a pun. There is no trap so likely to catch
    composers as the words <em>high</em> and <em>low</em>, <em>down</em> and <em>up</em>. “By G— (as
    Quin says) they must bite.” In what raptures was Purcel when he set
    “They that <em>go down</em> to the sea in ships.” How lucky a circumstance,
    that there was a singer at that time, who could <em>go down</em> to DD, and
    <em>go up</em> two Octaves above? for there is in other parts of the anthem a
    going <em>up</em> as well as <em>down</em>. The whole is a constellation of beauties
    of this kind. Handel had leisure, at the conclusion of an excellent
    movement, to endeavour at an imitation of the rocking of a cradle
    <span class="pagenum">51</span> (See
    the end of the anthem “My heart is inditing”), and has his <em>ups</em> and
    <em>downs</em> too in plenty. If many examples of this may be found in these
    great geniuses, it would be endless to enumerate the instances in
    those of the lower order. Let it suffice to observe, that all operas
    without exception, the greatest part of church-music, and particularly
    Marcello’s psalms, abound in this ridiculous imitative expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is trifling with the words and neglecting the sentiment; but the
    fault is much increased when a word is expressed in contradiction to
    the sentiment. A most flagrant instance of this is in Boyce’s Solomon,
    in the song of “Arise my<span class="pagenum">52</span>
    Fair One come away.”—The hero of the piece is
    inviting his mistress to come to him, and to tempt her the more, in
    describing the beauty of the spring, he tells her that
  </p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Stern winter’s <em>gone</em> with all its train</div>
        <div class="i0">“Of chilling frosts and dropping rain,”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    but it is <em>come</em> in the music—the unlucky words of <em>winter</em>, <em>frost</em>,
    and <em>rain</em>, made the composer set the lover a shivering, when he was
    full of the feelings of the “genial ray!”
  </p>

  <p>
    But sometimes expression of the sentiment is blameable, if such
    expression is improper for the general subject of the piece. Religious
    solemnity should not appear at the theatre, nor theatrical levity at
    the church. In the <cite>Stabat Mater</cite><span class="pagenum">53</span>
    of Pergolesi, and in the <cite>Messiah</cite>
    of Handel, there is an expression of whipping attempted, which, if
    it is understood at all, conveys either a ludicrous or prophane idea,
    according to the disposition of the hearer. Permit me to suspend my
    subject a moment just to observe, that there is sometimes mention
    made in plays, of providence, God, and other subjects, which are as
    incompatible with a place of public entertainment, as the common
    sentiments of plays are with the church. If we are disgusted at a
    theatrical preacher, we are not less offended when an actor heightens
    all these ill-placed sentiments—forcing them upon your notice by an
    affectation of a deep sense of religion,<span class="pagenum">54</span>
    and most solemnly preaching
    the sermon which the poet so improperly wrote.
  </p>

  <p>
    All these, and many more, are faults which musicians <em>really</em>
    commit; but a connoisseur will make them guilty of others, by way of
    compliment, which the composers never dreamt of. The introduction of
    the Coronation anthem, <cite>Zadok the Priest</cite>, is an arpeggio, which Handel
    probably took from his own performance at the harpsichord; but a great
    judge says, it is to express the murmurs of the people assembled in the
    abbey. “All we like sheep are gone astray” in the Messiah is considered
    as most excellently expressing the breaking out of sheep from a
    field.——<span class="pagenum">55</span>
    But out of pity to the connoisseurs, virtuosi, and the most
    respectable <i xml:lang="it">Conoscenti</i>, I will not increase my instances—God forbid
    I should rob any man of his criticism!
  </p>

  <p>
    Lest I should encroach upon <em>your</em> premises, I will quit such dangerous
    ground, and leave you with more celerity than ceremony.

    You will remember that it is the improper use of the parenthesis I
    object to and not to the thing itself. “This figure of composition,”
    says a late ingenious author, “which is hardly ever used in common
    discourse, is much employed by the best writers of antiquity, in order
    to give a cast and colour to their style different from common idiom,

    and ignorant of the cause; the reader also should have been ignorant
    until Pantheus explained<span class="pagenum">61</span>

    frightened them, had not the author unluckily said “that the strokes

    was a mill. The whole scene is highly pictoresque and beautiful.

  <p class="dropindent">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE productions of genius require some ages to be brought to
    perfection. The liberal arts have their infancy, youth and manhood;
    and, to carry on the allusion, continue sometime in a state of
    strength, and then verge by degrees to a decline, which at last ends in
    a total extinction. The English language, poetry, and music, exhibit
    proofs of this observation, as far as they have as yet gone: with the
    two former I have at present nothing to do, but
    <span class="pagenum">64</span> shall confine what I
    have to say on this subject to the latter.
  </p>

  <p>
    What the music of the times preceding Harry the eighth was, I confess
    myself ignorant, nor indeed is the knowledge of it necessary: we may
    conclude that it was more barbarous than that of the sixteenth century,
    as the times in which it was used were less enlightened. Some masses,
    mottets, and madrigals are what have reached us. The whole consists
    of a succession of chords without art or meaning, and perfectly
    destitute of air. In Elizabeth’s reign appeared some composers, Tallis,
    Bird, Morley, and Farrant, which improved the barren style of their
    predecessors: they had more choice<span class="pagenum">65</span>
    in their harmony, and made some
    little advances in melody. There are some pieces of instrumental
    music composed at this time which still exist: particularly a book
    of lessons, for the virginals, which was the Queen’s.—Whether the
    composers thought that her sacred Majesty excelled in musical abilities
    as much as in rank, or as she wished to do in beauty, I know not; but
    this is certain, that these pieces are so crowded with parts, and so
    aukwardly barbarous, as to render the performance of them impossible—so
    natural is it, even in the infancy of art, to mistake difficulty for
    beauty.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not recollect any composer that really improved music for the
    <span class="pagenum">66</span>
    first half of the seventeenth century, except Orlando Gibbons; of
    whom, a service for the church, and two or three anthems remain, the
    harmony of which is good, and the melody pleasing. In the Gloria Patri
    of the Nunc Dimittis is the best canon, in my judgment, that was ever
    made. Gibbons was also a composer for the virginals, but in no respect
    better than his predecessors. I believe it was about this time that
    the species of canon called the catch, was produced. The intent of my
    making this short recapitulation of the former state of music is purely
    prefatory to what I have to say upon the subject of catches.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">67</span>
    This odd species of composition, whenever invented, was brought to its
    perfection by Purcel. Real music was as yet in its childhood; but the
    reign of Charles the second carried every kind of vulgar debauchery
    to its height. The proper æra for the birth of such pieces as “when
    quartered, have ever three parts obscenity, and one part music.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The definition of a catch is a piece for three or more voices, one of
    which leads, and the others follow in the same notes. It must be so
    contrived, that rests (which are made for that purpose) in the music of
    one line be filled up with a word or two from another line; these form
    a cross-purpose or catch,<span class="pagenum">68</span>
    from whence the name. Now, this piece of wit
    is not judged perfect, if the result be not the rankest indecency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps this definition may be objected to, and I may be told that
    there are catches perfectly harmless. It is true that some pieces are
    called catches that have nothing to offend, and others that may justly
    pretend to please; but they want what is absolutely necessary for a
    catch—the break, and cross-purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may also be said that the result of the break, is not always
    indecency. I confess there are catches upon other subjects, drunkenness
    is a favourite one; which, though good, is not so <em>very</em> good
    <span class="pagenum">69</span> as the
    other: and there may possibly be found one or two upon other topicks
    which might be heard without disgust; but these are not sufficient to
    contradict a general rule, or make me retract what I have advanced.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will next examine their musical merit.—And this as compositions
    must consist either in their harmony, or melody; or their effect in
    performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The harmony of a catch is nothing more than the common result of
    filling up a chord.—There is not contrivance enough to make it esteemed
    as a piece of ingenuity. “What! they are all canons!” So is every
    tune in the world, if you will set it in three or more
    <span class="pagenum">70</span> parts, and
    sing those parts in succession as a catch—but a <em>real</em> canon is not
    so easily produced: it is one of those difficult trifles which costs
    an infinite deal of labour, and after all is worth nothing. I do not
    except the famous <i xml:lang="la">Non nobis</i> of Bird, in which are some passages not
    to be endured. The excellence in the composition of a catch consists in
    making the breaks, and filling them up properly. The melody is, for the
    most part, the unimproved vulgar drawl of the times of ignorance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us next attend to the manner of performance. One voice leads, a
    second follows, and a third, &amp;c. succeeds, unaccompanied with any
    instrument to keep them in<span class="pagenum">71</span>
    tune together. The consequence is, that the
    voices are always sinking, but not equally, for the best singer will
    keep nearest the pitch, and the others depart farthest from it. If
    the parts are doubled, which is sometimes the case, all these defects
    are multiplied. To this let there be added the imperfect scale of an
    uncultivated voice, the <em>departing</em> from the real sound by way of
    humour, the noise of so many people striving to outsing each other,
    the confusion of speaking different words at the same time, and all
    this heightened by the laughing and other accompaniments of the
    audience—it presents such a scene of savage folly as would not disgrace
    the Hottentots<span class="pagenum">72</span>
    indeed, but is not much to the credit of a company of
    civilized people.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the catch in a manner owed its existence to a drunken club, of which
    some musicians were members; upon their dying, it languished for years,
    and was scarce known except among choir-men, who now and then kept
    up the spirit of their forefathers. As the age grew more polished, a
    better style of music appeared. Corelli gave a new turn to instrumental
    music, and was successfully followed by Geminiani and Handel; the last
    excelled in vocal as well as instrumental music.
  </p>

  <p>
    There have been refinements and confessed improvements upon all these
    great men since; and no<span class="pagenum">73</span>
    doubt but at this time there are much better
    performers, and more elegant, tho’ less solid composers. This is the
    united effect of the labours of the whole together, for there is no
    <em>one man</em> to be compared with either of the above-mentioned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, if this were speculation only, is it credible that taste should
    revert to barbarism? Its natural death is, to be frittered away in
    false refinement; and yet, contrary to experience in every other
    instance, we have gone back a century, and catches flourish in the
    reign of George the third. There is a club composed of some of the
    first people in the kingdom which meet professedly to hear this species
    <span class="pagenum">74</span>
    of composition: they cultivate it and encourage it with premiums. To
    obtain which, many composers, who ought to be above such nonsense,
    become candidates, and produce such things

    Sometimes a piece makes its appearance that was lately found by
    accident after a concealment of a hundred and fifty years. When it
    is approved, and declared too excellent for these degenerate days,
    the author smiles and owns it. I scarce ever saw one of these things
    that did not betray itself, within three bars, to be modern. It is as
    difficult to imitate ancient music as ancient poetry; a few square
    notes<span class="pagenum">75</span>
    are not sufficient for the one, nor will two or three <em>whiloms</em>
    and <em>ekes</em> do for the other. And yet in this last instance a few
    affected antiquated spellings have been thought by one half of the
    world, sufficient to weigh against modern phraseology, modern manners,
    and even modern facts. Surely it requires no great discernment to
    discover that what has existed may be imitated, but nothing less than
    the gift of Prescience can dive into futurity. If it is <em>improbable</em>
    that an uneducated boy should be able to produce what are called
    Rowley’s Poems, it is <em>impossible</em> that Rowley could write in a style
    and allude to facts of after times. Forgive me this digression, but
    <span class="pagenum">76</span>
    indeed I have nearly finished my subject and letter.

  <p>
    I profess that I never heard a catch sung, but I felt more ashamed
    than I can express. I pretend to no more delicacy than that of the
    age I live in, which is very properly too refined to endure such
    barbarisms—I was ashamed for myself—for my company—and if a foreigner
    was present—for my country.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has just occurred to me that you like catches, and frequently help
    to sing them—revenge yourself for the liberties I have taken, by
    compelling me to hear some of these pleasant ditties, when perhaps I

    performance, while I lament that so noble a subscription should be
    lavished for so poor a purpose as keeping alive musical false-wit,
    when it might so powerfully support and encourage the best style
    of composition; and rather advance our taste by anticipating the
    improvements of the coming age, than force it back to times of
    barbarism, from which it has cost us such pains to emerge.

    In the authors before the reign of Elizabeth, there seems not the least
    pretence to a simple, natural style. A man was held unfit to write, who
    could not express his thoughts out of the common
    <span class="pagenum">79</span> language; so that it
    is possible, there was as much difficulty in understanding them at the
    time they lived, as now. If we are to judge of the English they spoke,
    by that they writ, we have no reason to complain of the fluctuation
    of our tongue. But it is very probable that conversation-language was
    much the same two hundred years ago as at present; there are proofs of
    this in private letters still existing—I mean from such people as had
    no ambition to be thought learned, or from such as felt too much for
    affectation. The famous letter of Ann Boleyn to Henry the eighth, is
    of this last sort, in which there is scarce an obsolete expression.——I
    hope you make a<span class="pagenum">80</span>
    distinction between expression and spelling—for as I
    once observed to you, it is but of late that our orthography has been
    fixed. In the State-tryals in Elizabeth and James’s reign, we find near
    the same language we use at present, and this was taken immediately
    from the mouth. In those passages where Shakespeare’s genius had not
    its full scope, may be observed his attempts to be thought learned, and
    refined; but where the subject was too impetuous to brook restraint,
    the language is as perfect as the idea. Upon the whole, tho’ the
    colloquial English was much the same as at present, we may safely
    pronounce the style of the <em>authors</em> of this period to be barbarous.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">81</span>
    The disputes between Charles the first and the Parliament, were
    of great use in polishing the language; and tho’ the King’s papers
    are thought to be most elegant, yet it is evident that both parties
    endeavoured at strength for the good of their cause, and at perspicuity
    for the sake of being universally understood—and these two principles
    go near towards making a perfect style. Milton’s prose is in general
    very nervous, but it is not free from stiffness and affectation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other period is that of Addison. He was undoubtedly one of our
    smoothest and best writers: he had the skill of uniting ease, strength,
    and correctness, and did<span class="pagenum">82</span>
    more towards improving the language than the
    united labours of fifty years before him. But yet there were some
    little remains of barbarism still left, which are evident enough in his
    contemporaries, and may be discovered even in him, by attending to the
    style and not to the matter. Will you believe that so elegant a writer
    has used <em>authenticalness</em> for <em>authenticity</em>?——You may find this
    horrid word in his Dialogues on Medals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Political disputes have produced, among many bad effects, the same
    good, now, as formerly—they have improved our language. Those in the
    Administration of Sir Robert Walpole, but more particularly these in
    our own times, have occasioned<span class="pagenum">83</span>
    some of the most perfect pieces of
    writing we have in our tongue. Though, from the nature of the subject,
    the pieces themselves can scarce exist longer than the dispute which
    gave them being; yet certainly their effect upon the language will be
    felt when the quarrel itself is no more, and every thing relating to it
    forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tho’ I have affirmed that our language is more perfect now than in any
    past period—yet there is still much left in it to be corrected.—Indeed
    there are some defects in all languages, which have crept in by
    degrees, and are so sanctified by custom, that they can never be
    corrected. In English there is no difference in writing, tho’ there is
    <span class="pagenum">84</span>
    in pronouncing, the present, and preterperfect tenses of the verbs
    <em>read</em>, and <em>eat</em>, and some others. Some unsuccessful attempts have
    been made to distinguish them by writing <em>redde</em> and <em>ate</em>. There are
    more words in Latin of contrary significations which are written the
    same, than, I believe, in any other language. It is a <em>defect</em> if the
    pronunciation of different words be alike, and a great <em>fault</em> if such
    a pronunciation be the consequence of a refinement. We now pronounce
    <em>fore</em> and <em>four</em>, the same; which sometimes makes an odd confusion. “I
    will come to you at three, I can’t come <em>before</em>”—and “I will come to
    you at three, I can’t come <em>by four</em>”—are pronounced
    <span class="pagenum">85</span> just the same way.
    This we get by affectedly dropping the <em>u</em>. In French <i xml:lang="fr">au dessous</i>
    and <i xml:lang="fr">au dessus</i> are too much alike for contrary significations. Nature
    dictates a difference of sound for different meanings: the adverbs of
    negation and assent, bear no resemblance to each other in any language;
    and almost all languages agree in some such sound as <em>no</em> for denial.
  </p>

  <p>
    The London dialect is the cause of many improprieties, which, if they
    were only used in conversation, would not much signify; but as they
    have begun to make part of our written language, they deserve some
    animadversion. To mention a few. The custom among
    <span class="pagenum">86</span> the common people
    of adding an <em>s</em> to many words, has, I believe, occasioned its being
    fixed to some, by writers of rank, who on account of their residence
    in London did not perceive the impropriety. They speak, and write,
    <em>chickens</em>—<em>coals</em>—<em>acquaintances</em>—<em>assistances</em>, &amp;c. <em>Chicken</em> is
    itself the plural of <em>chick</em>, as <em>oxen</em> is of <em>ox</em>, <em>kine</em> (<em>cowen</em>)
    is of <em>cow</em>, and many others. <em>Coal</em>, <em>acquaintance</em>, being aggregate
    nouns, admit of no plural termination, nor does <em>assistance</em>. If I were
    to say a bag of shots, or sands, the impropriety would be instantly
    perceived; and yet one is full as good English as the other. A certain
    author of great credit, who has taken a strict, nay, a verbal
    <span class="pagenum">87</span> review of
    the English language, uses them as often as they occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the Londoners speak, so they also write <em>learn</em> for <em>teach</em>, this
    is a very old mistake, and occurs frequently in the psalms, <em>do</em> for
    <em>does</em> (and the contrary), <em>set</em> for <em>sit</em>, <em>see</em> for <em>saw</em>, <em>tin</em> for
    <em>latten</em> (which are two different things as well as words), <em>sulky</em>
    for <em>sullen</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c. <em>’Change</em> and <em>’sample</em> have been long admitted
    denizens.——Even in a dictionary you may find <em>million</em> explained to be
    a fruit well known—as perhaps in a future edition we shall be told that
    a <em>fly</em> signifies a <em>coach</em>, and <em>dilly</em> a <em>chaise</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The London <em>phraseology</em> has also been too hard for English. <em>I got
    me up</em>—<em>he sets him down</em>—<em>I got no<span class="pagenum">88</span>
    sleep</em>—<em>I slept none</em>—such a thing is
    <em>a</em> doing—<em>a</em> going—<em>a</em> coming—<em>live</em> lobsters—<em>live</em>-cattle—I will
    call <em>of</em> you—do not tell <em>on</em> it. All these are writ without scruple.
    Our modern comedies, and the London news-papers, abound so much in this
    language, that they are scarce intelligible to one who has never been
    in the capital. Nay in books for the use of schools, the London dialect
    is so predominant, that many of the sentences are not to be understood
    by a country boy, and impossible to be rendered into Latin even by
    those who do understand them. “I will go and fetch a walk in the Green
    Park”—“I will go get me my dinner,” and such jargon is perpetually
    occurring.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">89</span>
    English has also been corrupted by London <em>emphasis</em> and <em>accent</em>—I
    will not tire you by quoting examples, of which a long list might
    be made to prove the great propensity of the common people to those
    defects; and would be a farther confirmation of what I just now
    advanced, that men of learning really commit improprieties, because
    their ear is familiarized to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have yet something to add on this subject—but I must caution you
    from imagining that because I find out the faults of others, I pretend
    to perfection myself. Hogarth says very properly in his Analysis
    of Beauty, “do not look<span class="pagenum">90</span>
    for good drawing in those examples which I
    bring of grace and beauty—they are purposely neglected—attend to the
    precept.”

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU have not done me justice—read the memoirs I sent you <em>properly</em>
    before they are condemned:—what is any book if it be not read in that
    manner by which it may best be understood? A novel, whose merit lies
    chiefly in the story, should be quickly passed through; for the closer
    you can bring the several circumstances together, the better. If its
    merit consists in character and sentiment, it should be read much
    slower; for the least<span class="pagenum">95</span>
    obvious parts of a character are frequently the
    most beautiful, and the propriety of a sentiment may easily escape in
    a hasty perusal. Detached thoughts ought to be dwelt on longer than
    any other manner of writing; for different subjects following close,
    do rather confound than instruct; but if we allowed ourselves time to
    reflect, we should understand the author and perhaps improve ourselves.
    Each thought should be considered as a text, upon which we ought to
    make a commentary.

  <p>
    Bayle’s manner of writing by text and note is generally decried, but
    without reason. When there is a necessity of proving the assertion
    by quotation, which was his<span class="pagenum">96</span>
    case, no other way can be taken equally
    perspicuous. The authorities must be produced somewhere—they cannot be
    in the text, and if they are put at the end of the book, which is the
    modern fashion, how much more troublesome are they for referring to,
    than by being at the bottom of the page? The truth is, this is another
    instance of ignorance in the method of reading. Bayle, Harris, and
    other writers of this class, should have the text read first, which is
    quickly dispatched; then, begin again and take in the notes. By this
    means you preserve a connection, and judge of the proofs of what is

    de Chambre?” said the great Condé, and he might have added, “or to his
    friends?” Besides the obvious reason for this, it is most likely that
    an author has in his common conversation made his friends acquainted
    with his sentiments long before they are communicated to the public.
    The consequence is, that to <em>them</em> his work is not new; and it is
    possible that they may take to themselves part of his merit; for I have

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>E are got into a custom of mentioning Shakespeare and Jonson together,
    and many think them of equal merit, tho’ in different ways. In my
    opinion, Jonson is one of the dullest writers I ever read, and his
    plays, with some few exceptions, the most unentertaining I ever saw. He
    has some shining passages now and then, but not enough to make up for
    his deficiencies. Shakespeare,<span class="pagenum">100</span>
    on the contrary, abundantly recompenses
    for being sometimes low and trifling. One of his commentators much
    admires his great art in the construction of his verses—I dare say
    they are very perfect; but it is as much out of my power to think upon
    the art of verse-making when I am reading this divine poet, as it is
    to consider of the best way of making fiddle-strings at a concert. I
    am not master of myself sufficiently to do any thing that requires
    deliberation: I am taken up like a leaf in a whirlwind, and dropped at
    Thebes or Athens, as the poet pleases!
  </p>

  <p>
    I have seldom any pleasure from the representation of Shakespeare’s
    plays, unless it be from some scenes
    <span class="pagenum">101</span> of conversation merely,
    without passion. The speeches which have any thing violent in the
    expression, are generally so over-acted as to cease to be the “mirror
    of nature”—but this was always the case—“Oh! it offends me to the
    soul, to see a robustious perriwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
    tatters:”—’tho’ this is a “lamentable thing,” yet it appears to be
    without remedy. An actor, in a large theatre, is like a picture hung
    at a distance, if the touches are delicate, they escape the sight:
    both must be extravagant to be seen at all, and hence the custom of
    the ancients to make use of the Persona and Buskin. Acting has a
    very different effect in the stage-box<span class="pagenum">102</span>
    from what it has in the back
    of the gallery. In the one, every thing appears rough and rude,
    like a picture of Spagnolet’s near the eye; in the other, it is with
    difficulty that the play can be made out. Perhaps, the best place is
    the front of the first gallery; as being sufficiently removed to soften
    these hardnesses, yet near enough to see and hear with advantage.
    But there is no place can alter the impropriety of rant and turgid
    declamation, which the performer naturally runs into by endeavouring to
    be strong enough to be heard—so that, as I observed, the evil seems to
    be incurable.

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>N acquaintance of ours has corresponded with a writing-master many
    years, not from any regard to the man, but for the pleasure he takes
    in seeing fine writing. He preserves his letters carefully, and though
    he <em>reads</em> them to none, (perhaps they are still unread by himself) he
    <em>shews</em> them to all who can relish the excellence of a flourish “long
    drawn out.”——Our friend’s taste may be ridiculed by those who “hold
    it a baseness to<span class="pagenum">104</span>
    write fair,” but yet it is certain, that the true
    form of letters, in writing, is understood no where but in England.
    I never saw a specimen of a correct hand either written or engraved,
    from any other country, that was upon a right principle. Perhaps it
    may be objected, that every nation, prejudiced in favour of their own
    particular manner, will say the same thing. Let us examine this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modern writing-hand had its rise from an endeavour to form the true
    letters as they are printed, with expedition. The first variation from
    the original, must be an oblique instead of a perpendicular situation,
    this naturally arises from the position of the hand—the next, a joining
    <span class="pagenum">105</span>
    of the letters; these two necessarily produce a third, an alteration
    of the form. So that writing hand differs from printing in this, that
    the former is an arrangement of <em>connected</em> characters, the latter of
    distinct ones. The slit in the pen makes the down-strokes full, and
    the up-strokes slight, so that the body of the letter is strong, and
    the joinings weak; as they should be. It is most natural and easy also
    to hold the pen always in the same position, by which means, the full
    and hair-strokes are always in their right places. So far seems the
    necessary consequence of endeavouring to make the letters expeditiously
    with a pen. This being<span class="pagenum">106</span>
    granted, the ornamental part comes next to
    be considered. For this, it is requisite that the letters should
    be of the same size and distance, that their leaning should be in
    the same direction, that the joining be as much as possible uniform,
    and, lastly, that the superadded ornament of flourishing, should be
    continued in the same position of the pen in which it was first begun,
    (generally the reverse of the usual way of holding it), and that the
    forms be distinct, flowing, and graceful.
  </p>

  <p>
    These appear to me to be the true principles of writing. Examine the
    Italian and French hands by these rules, (some of the best specimens
    are the titles of prints, &amp;c.)<span class="pagenum">107</span>
    and the hand which they use will be
    found to be unconnected, full of unmeaning twists and curlings
    generally produced by altering the position of the pen, and upon the
    whole awkward, stiff, and ungraceful.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they <em>now</em> write, we <em>did</em>, about seventy or eighty years since; so
    that our present beautiful hand is a new one, and by its being used no
    where but in England, I must conclude it to be an English invention.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have often reflected with great grief, that there is scarce any
    remarkable natural object in the sublime style, of which we have
    a draught, to be depended on. The cataract of Niagara.—The peak
    of Teneriffe, we know nothing of but that the one is the greatest
    waterfall, and the other the highest single mountain in the world.
    It is true, Condamine says, that the Andes far surpass the peak of
    Teneriffe; more than a third—but,<span class="pagenum">109</span>
    it should be considered, that the
    valley of Quito is 1600 fathoms above the sea, and that it is from
    the foot of the mountain that the eye judges of its height. The peak
    of Teneriffe rises at once, and has, comparatively, but a small
    base—so that, in appearance, Teneriffe is the highest of mountains.
    The cataract of Niagara, indeed, is most excellently <em>described</em> by
    Mr. Kalm; but all descriptions of visible objects comes so short
    of a representation, and is necessarily so imperfect, that if ten
    different painters were to read Mr. Kalm’s account of this amazing
    fall, and to draw it from his description, we should have as many
    different draughts as painters. The peak
    <span class="pagenum">110</span> of Teneriffe has been ascended
    by many, but described by none, for I cannot call those accounts
    descriptions, which would suit any other high mountain as well. Some
    travellers give views of what they apprehend to be curious, but all
    that we can find from them is, that they cannot possibly be like the
    object described. There must be some amazing scenes in Norway by
    Pontoppidan’s Descriptions, and in the Alps by Schuchtzer’s, but their
    draughts cannot bear the least resemblance to what they describe. Nay,
    those objects which lie in the common road of travellers have just the
    same fate.—The view of Lombardy from the Alps—the bay of Naples—the
    appearance of<span class="pagenum">111</span>
    Genoa, from the sea, &amp;c. &amp;c. are much talked of, but
    never drawn: or if drawn, not published. From this general censure
    I should except a view of Vesuvius taken by a pupil of Vernet’s, and
    two views of the Giant’s causeway in Ireland, but above all Gaspar
    Poussin’s drawings from Tivoli. These have something so characteristic,
    that we may be sure that they give a proper idea of the scenes from
    whence they were taken. Of the many thousands that are constantly going
    to the East-Indies, not one has published a drawing of the Cape of Good
    Hope, nor of Adam’s peak in Ceylon, nor fifty other remarkable objects
    which are seen in<span class="pagenum">112</span>
    that voyage.——Even the rock of Gibraltar is as yet
    undrawn. What I mean by a drawing is a <em>pictoresque</em> view, not a meer
    outline for the use of navigators, nor the unmeaning marks of a pencil
    directed by ignorance. I greatly suspect the so much commended draughts
    in Anson’s voyage to be nothing but outlines filled up at random; and
    more than suspect, that many designs in a late publication of this
    sort, are mere inventions at home.

    I have been led into this subject by the two admirable descriptions
    of Ætna by Sir W. Hamilton and Brydone—as much as <em>words</em> can realize

    But yet, a dozen different views taken
    by real artists, would have done more in an instant, than any effect
    within the power of description.

    Poetry and painting, I believe, are only allied to music and to each
    other; but music, besides having the above-named ladies for sisters,
    has also astronomy and geometry for brothers, and grammar—for a cousin,
    at least. I am sure I have left out many of the family,
    <span class="pagenum">115</span> though, if
    I could enumerate what seems at present the whole, it is odds, but
    there would be a new relation discovered soon by an adept in this
    business.—Why should not I find out one or two?—I will try.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let me see—what is there near me? Oh! a standish—music then shall be
    like my standish. Any thing else?—Yes—like the grate—or like that shirt
    now hanging by the fire, which makes so excellent a screen.
  </p>

  <p>“How prove you this in your great wisdom?”</p>

  <p>
    Marry! thus—music bears great analogy to my standish; because there
    is one bottle for the ink, another for the sand, and the third for
    wafers—these are evidently the unison,
    <span class="pagenum">116</span> third, and fifth, which make a
    compleat chord; and those three a compleat standish.—The pen is so
    evidently the plectrum, that it is insulting you to mention it.
  </p>

  <p>“But why like the grate?”</p>

  <p>
    Bless me! did you never see a testudo,—a lyre? The bars are the
    strings, the back is the belly—need I enlarge? What is the fire but the
    vis musica?—and here, the poker is the plectrum.
  </p>

  <p>“But how can it possibly be like the shirt?”</p>

  <p>
    Pho! any thing in analogy is possible.—Like my shirt?—Why, the body
    is the bass, the sleeves are two trebles—the ruffles are shakes and
    flourishes—the three buttons of the collar are evidently the common
    <span class="pagenum">117</span>
    chord.—But, a truce with such nonsense.—There are scarce any two
    things in the world but may be <em>made</em> to resemble each other. Permit me
    to shew the slightness of another received opinion concerning music.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What passion cannot music raise or quell?” says Dryden, or Pope, I
    forget which: and the same thought is so often expressed by other
    poets, and so generally adopted by all authors upon this subject,
    that it would be a bold attempt to contradict it, were there not
    an immediate appeal to general feeling, which I hope is superior
    to all authority. Thus supported then, I ask in my turn—“What
    passion <em>can</em> music raise or quell?” Who ever felt himself affected,
    <span class="pagenum">118</span>
    otherwise than with pleasure, at those strains which are supposed
    to inspire grief—rage—joy—or pity? and this, in a degree, equal
    to the goodness of the composition and performance. The effect of
    music, in this instance, is just the same as of poetry. We attend—are
    pleased—delighted—transported—and when the heart can bear no more,
    “glow, tremble, and weep.” All these are but different degrees of pure
    <em>pleasure</em>. When a poet or musician has produced this last effect, he
    has attained the utmost in the power of poetry or music. Tears being
    a general expression of grief, pain, and pity; and music, when in its
    perfection, producing them, has occasioned the mistake, of its raising
    <span class="pagenum">119</span>
    the passions of grief, &amp;c. But tears, in fact, are nothing but the
    mechanical effect of every strong affection of the heart, and produced
    by all the passions; even joy and rage. It is this effect, and the
    pleasurable sensation together, which Offian (whether ancient or modern
    I care not) calls the “joy of grief.”——It is this effect, when produced
    by some grand image, which Dr. Blair, his Critic, styles the “sublime
    pathetic.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I have chosen to illustrate these observations from poetry rather than
    from music, because it is more generally understood, and easier to
    quote—but the principle is equal in both the arts.

  <p class="dropindent">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR pictures came safe—my opinion of them you will in part know from
    the following observations, which, though made on another occasion, are
    equally applicable to this.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is in landscape-painting and novel-writing a fault committed by
    some of the best artists and authors, which is as yet unnamed, because
    perhaps unnoticed, permit me to call it <em>a bad association</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum">121</span>
    In a landscape, it is not sufficient that all the objects are such
    as may well be found together.—In a story, it is not enough that the
    incidents are such as may well happen—it is necessary in both, that all
    the circumstances should be of the <em>same family</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose a landscape had for its subject one of Gaspar Poussin’s Views
    of Tivoli—now, tho’ there is nothing more natural than to find mills
    by running water, yet a mill is not an object that can possibly agree
    with the other parts of the picture. Suppose in a landscape of Ruysdale
    there were introduced the ruins of a temple; tho’ a temple may be
    properly placed in a wood near water, yet it does not suit the rustic
    <span class="pagenum">122</span>
    simplicity of the pictures of this artist.—Give the mill to Ruysdale
    and the temple to Gaspar—all will be right. These two painters were the
    most perfect in their different styles that ever existed. Both formed
    themselves upon the study of nature, both were correct, both excellent;
    and yet so totally different from each other, that there are scarce
    any parts of the pictures of one, that will bear being introduced into
    those of the other. Claude’s magnificent ideas frequently betrayed him
    into <em>a bad association</em>.——Large grand masses of trees agree but ill
    with sea and ships, unless they are removed to a distance.—An English
    painter, who formed himself upon<span class="pagenum">123</span>
    the study of Gaspar, took his trees,
    rocks, and other circumstances from that master, but his buildings
    from the Gardiner’s huts at Newington.
  </p>

  <p>
    A story which proceeds upon a regular circumscribed plan, chiefly
    consisting of dialogue and sentiment, where the scene is laid in
    London, and the characters such as are natural to the place; has
    <em>a bad association</em> if the author goes to Africa in quest of adventures. On
    the other hand, a novel which sets out upon the principle of variety,
    and where a frequent change of place is necessary to the execution of
    the design, has <em>a bad association</em> if the author in any part of it
    quits adventure for sentiment or satire.
    <span class="pagenum">124</span> And yet, this has been done by
    Fielding and Smollet, the two best novel-writers of the age.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
